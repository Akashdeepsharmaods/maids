                <h2>Quality & Integrity Sice the Beginning</h2>
                <p>Founded in 1979, The Maids is a leading residential cleaning services company in the U.S. and Canada. We are a quality leader among the many home cleaning companies in the industry, with nearly 200 franchises serving over 90 major U.S. and Canadian cities. Our offices can be found in over 40 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces.</p>
                <p>Daniel J. Bishop, a self-made entrepreneur before the age of 21 with his janitorial company, Bishop Building Services, founded The Maids in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. He focused on bringing residential deep cleaning services to everyone. With house cleaning teams and a recognizable yellow company car, Bishop’s business quickly went national as he began franchising his residential cleaning company one year later.</p>

                <h2>Our Efficient Approach Through Team Home Cleaning</h2>

                <p>Before starting The Maids, Bishop researched the home cleaning process. Through time and motion studies, his research determined the most efficient way to clean a home is through team cleaning. Bishop trained each member of his home cleaning company to clean with a system based on four primary functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dusting</li>
                    <li>Bathroom cleaning</li>
                    <li>Kitchen cleaning</li>
                    <li>Vacuuming</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Through this regimented home cleaning system, The Maids house cleaning teams were able to clean quickly and efficiently. Although our team cleaning approach and system have evolved over the years, much of our core efficiencies can be traced back to Bishop’s motion studies and original cleaning system.</p>
                <p>In 1995, The Maids became the first home cleaning business to clean for health. This was accomplished by using environmentally preferred cleaning products and a state-of-the-art backpack vacuum to improve air quality in the homes we cleaned. This resulted in the development of our unique 22-Step Cleaning Process, which set new standards for quality deep cleaning and revolutionized the industry.</p>
                <p>With over 40 years of experience, The Maids continues to research the best ways to serve our customers. We continue to stay at the forefront of the home services industry and remain a model organization in the franchising world.</p>
                <h2>The Maids Executive Leadership</h2>
                <p>Since our founding, The Maids has grown to be one of the largest domestic cleaning companies throughout the U.S. and Canada. We are dedicated to providing you and your family with state-of-the-art home cleaning service options and continue to lead the home service industry by example.</p>
